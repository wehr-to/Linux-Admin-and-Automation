# 🐧 Linux-Admin-and-Automation

Multi-distro Linux administration and automation toolkit — built across **Ubuntu**, **Debian**, **Arch**, and **Kali** — to demonstrate practical operations, secure configuration, and scripted efficiency.

## 📌 Purpose

This repo is a hands-on showcase of real-world Linux operations, emphasizing:
- Core system administration across multiple distributions
- Shell and Python-based automation tasks
- Hardening and security operations
- Platform consistency despite distro differences

It’s ideal for aspiring DevOps, SysAdmins, SecOps, and IT professionals who want distro fluency and automation readiness.

- ✅ Package installation and system updates
- ✅ SSH config, firewall rules, and sudo lockdown
- ✅ Automated log rotation and cleanup
- ✅ System performance monitoring scripts
- ✅ Secure file transfer and backups
- ✅ Hardening tasks (fail2ban, UFW, apparmor, etc.)
- ✅ Multi-distro nuances: `apt`, `pacman`, `dpkg`, etc.

## 🔄 Automation Tools

- Bash
- Python (for scripting + subprocess)
- Ansible (optional)
- Crontabs / systemd timers

## 💼 Use Cases
